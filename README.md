### Summary

This ebook is an attempt to create an open-source extensive tutorial on Test-Driven Development. It's a work in progress and any contribution is welcome.

### Book plan

The following parts are planned. The current table of content is available on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/tdd-ebook).

*  *Part 1: Just The Basics*

The book is already over 150 pages, but there is still lots to do! Your input is crucial!

### Contributing

The source code is now in markdown, so it is easier to contribute than 
ever! I welcome issues and pull requests about typos, better phrasing, 
requests for clearer explanation etc. Also if you've got some 
questions, topic requests, would like to submit better (or new) 
exercises or correct the existing ones, please submit an issue as well.

You are welcome to fork this ebook and make a customized version for the 
programming language of your choice or edit the terminology or 
conventions if you do not like what I decided on. It's Open Source!
